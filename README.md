# Global Female Education Attainment: Data Visualization and Insights

## Website Link : https://sheebamoghal.georgetown.domains/data_viz/index.html

## Abstract
This project delves into the global disparities in female education attainment, focusing on data from the World Bank (2010-2018, with some historical data dating back to 1970). By exploring metrics such as gross enrollment ratios, labor force composition, and economic factors like GDP and GNI per capita, the project visualizes trends and inequities in female education access across regions. The primary objective is to provide policymakers, researchers, and development practitioners with actionable insights to address gender gaps in education and design targeted interventions.

## Focus on Data Visualization
To effectively communicate findings and uncover patterns in the data, a wide array of visualization tools and techniques were employed, including:

- **Observable**: Used for creating interactive data narratives and seamlessly integrating charts and maps into the analysis.
- **Bokeh**: Enabled the creation of detailed and interactive plots to visualize relationships between variables such as education levels and economic indicators.
- **Altair**: Utilized for its declarative syntax to create concise yet powerful visualizations of regional and temporal trends in education metrics.
- **Folium**: Integrated for mapping geographic disparities in female education enrollment across regions.
- **D3.js**: Employed for building custom, dynamic, and scalable visualizations that enhance the storytelling experience.

## Key Visualizations
1. **Gross Enrollment Ratios**: 
   - Interactive maps and bar charts illustrating enrollment disparities by education level (primary, secondary, tertiary).
   - Highlighted regions with significant gender gaps and pinpointed outliers with exceptionally high or low enrollment ratios.

2. **Regional Trends Over Time**: 
   - Visualized historical trends in female enrollment (1970-2013) across regions using line charts and interactive filters.
   - Showcased areas of progress and persistent challenges in achieving educational equity.

3. **Labor Force Composition**: 
   - Explored the relationship between education attainment and labor force participation by gender, using grouped bar charts for high, middle, and low-income countries.

4. **Economic Correlations**: 
   - Scatterplots and bubble charts illustrating the link between GDP/GNI per capita and female enrollment rates.
   - Highlighted deviations where high-income regions showed lower-than-expected enrollment or vice versa.

5. **Government Spending**: 
   - Comparative visualizations of government spending on education (2014-2018) per capita, displayed through heatmaps and relative/absolute change plots.

## Insights
The combination of visualization tools provided a nuanced perspective on global trends and disparities. Interactive and geographically focused tools like Folium and Observable allowed for granular regional analysis, while declarative frameworks like Altair and Bokeh enabled quick iteration and clear representation of high-dimensional data. Together, these tools helped uncover systemic challenges and highlight areas for policy prioritization.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the power of data visualization in bringing complex global issues to light. By leveraging diverse tools and methodologies, we were able to make the data more accessible, actionable, and engaging for stakeholders aiming to close the gender gap in education. The insights and visualizations provide a foundation for further analysis and advocacy in the pursuit of global educational equity.
